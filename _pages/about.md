Jordan is a soon-to-be academic librarian passionate about critical librarianship, research ethics and methods, library pedagogy, and ecological STEM and GIS. During her first master’s, Jordan developed a deep connection with academic libraries and their role in collaborative creation equitable and accessible learning environments and communities through innovative and experiential instruction. When not creating or collaborating in libraries, I’m out in the mountains hiking, climbing, skiing, and other activities my spouse, Scott (a high school teacher), and pooch Chai (a lifelong educator in the simple pleasures). Jordan looks forward to engaging with the LibParlour community on research, pedagogy, and the role of libraries and librarians in a changing world!
